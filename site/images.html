	<h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</li>
		<li>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</li>
		<li>I want to put a ding in the universe.</li>
		<li>Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.</li>
		<li>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.</li>
		<li>It's better to be a pirate than to join the Navy.</li>
		<li>The hardest thing when you think about focusing. You think focusing is about saying "Yes." No. Focusing is about saying "No." And when you say "No," you piss off people.</li>
		<li>I'm as proud of what we don't do as I am of what we do.</li>
		<li>I would trade all of my technology for an afternoon with Socrates.</li>
		<li>It's rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing.</li>
